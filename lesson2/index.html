            <p>
                Google Fonts API has a good use of white-space making it have
                a clean design. The spacing around all the objects allows
                people who are viewing the page to stay calm when looking for
                a font.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clean design comes mostly from the fact that all the fonts
                are separated into boxes and have spacing between them it
                just makes it more simple.

            <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
            <div>
            <p><span>Brigham Young University - Idaho</span></p>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.byui.edu/search/result?q=Rule+of+Thirds">byui.edu</a></p>
            <img src="images/byui-edu-rule-of-thirds.jpg" alt="example of 'rule of thirds' from byui's website">
            <p>
                The image at the bottom of the screenshot follows the "Rule
                of Thirds", the focal point (the woman's face) is off to the
                right and the text (another focal point) is off to the left.
            </p>
            <p>
                When images and the text are aligned in that way, it, for one,
                makes it easier to see the focus of the image as well as being
                able to read the text, which is probably the reason why both
                elements were place on the page...

            <h3>Alignment</h3>
            <div>
            <p><span>GitHub</span></p>
            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.github.com/">github.com</a></p>
            <img src="images/github.jpg" alt="example of alignment from the GitHub website">
            <p>
                The 6 logos at the bottom are aligned (in pairs) vertically
                and horizontally, it makes it simple and easy to understand.
                All the elements on the page are horizontally centered,
                making a direction of reading.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alignment is probably one of the most important parts of design
                principles. You can use alignment to do nearly all of the other
                ideas/concepts. If you know how to use the alignment techniques
                properly, it will make your page look more appealing.
